    <p id="first" class="aboutme">
      Hey There! I’m Jun, a UX/UI designer who crossed over to UX design from
      the hospitality industry. From coming up with solutions for guests’ needs
      and concerns, to creating exceptional experiences for all of our hotel
      guests - I was able to practice and hone in on my problem solving and
      empathy skills on a daily basis.
    </p>
    <p id="second" class="aboutme">
      As a UX/UI designer, I’m able to transfer those problem solving skills to
      my research and ideation phase by designing an enjoyable user experience
      by putting myself in the shoe’s of the users. What intrigues me about
      design is that it is ever changing and constantly evolving to be better
      than what it was before .
    </p>
    <p id="third" class="aboutme">
      Apart from the user experience, I am passionate about traveling and
      discovering a city through the people and food. I also enjoy cooking
      recipes found on YouTube and making my friends test them with me.
